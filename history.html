                    <h2>History of Valladolid</h2>
                    <p>From its humble beginnings as a small settlement in the Middle Ages, Valladolid has witnessed and played a leading role in key moments of Spanish's history. Founded in the 11<sup>th</sup> century by Count Pedro Ansúrez, the city quickly rose in importance, hosting the royal court and becoming the capital of the Spanish Empire during the reign of Philip II</p>

                    <h4>Foundation and Middle Ages</h4>
                    <p>Count Pedro Ansúrez is considered the founder of the city in 1072, when he was granted lordship over the town. He promoted its development with the construction of the Collegiate Church of Santa María (now the Cathedral) and the Church of La Antigua. In 1346, its prestigious University was founded.</p>

                    <h4>Capital of the Empire and Golden Age</h4>
                    <p>Valladolid reached its peak during the Golden Age. In 1469, the Catholic Monarchs, Isabel and Ferdinand, were married at the Vivero Palace. Later, Philip II was born in the city and established it as the capital. During this period, Miguel de Cervantes lived in Valladolid and published the first edition of Don Quixote here in 1604. Tragically, Christopher Columbus died in Valladolid in 1506.</p>

                    <h4>Modern Era</h4>
                    <p>After the permanent transfer of the court to Madrid, the city went through a period of decline. It was not until the 19<sup>th</sup> century, with the arrival of the railway, that Valladolid began its industrial transformation, becoming an important manufacturing and communications center.</p>
